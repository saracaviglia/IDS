This is a project I did for my Introduction to Data Science course (University of Genoa, 2024). The project was an analysis on a given dataset: in this case, the dataset is Spotify dataset with more than 160k songs from 1921 to 2020.<br>
You can find the data set at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fcpercival/160k-spotify-songs-sorted?select=data.csv.
